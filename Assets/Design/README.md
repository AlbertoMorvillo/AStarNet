# Graphic Assets Design

This directory contains the original design files used to create the project's graphical assets.
All assets follow a structured design process to ensure consistency and scalability.

## Files Overview

- **`AStarLogoConstruction.3dm`** - Geometric construction file of the logo *(Rhinoceros)*.
- **`AStarLogo.ai`** - Primary design file for the logo *(Adobe Illustrator)*.
- **`AStarBanner.ai`** - Repository banner design *(Adobe Illustrator)*.

## Design & Export Process

1. **Geometric Construction** > The logo was initially designed in **Rhinoceros (.3dm)** to ensure mathematical precision.
2. **Vector Refinement** > The construction file was imported into **Adobe Illustrator (.ai)** for fine-tuning and styling.
3. **Final Export** > Assets were exported in **SVG and PNG (1024x1024 px)** formats.
4. **Icon Optimization** > PNGs were converted into **ICO (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256 px)** using **GIMP**.

## Modifications & Workflow

To update any graphical asset:  
- **Always modify the `.3dm` and `.ai` source files first** to maintain design accuracy.
- **Re-export the assets in the required formats** following the steps above.
- **Keep file naming consistent** to avoid breaking references.

## Tools Used

These design files were created and edited using the following software:

- [Rhinoceros](https://www.rhino3d.com/) - Used for geometric construction.
- [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) - Used for vector refinement and final design.
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - Used for PNG to ICO conversion.
